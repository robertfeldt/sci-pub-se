# "Scientific Publishing in SE" PhD Course

This is the home page for the PhD course "Scientific Publishing in SE" given by Robert Feldt. 

## Introduction
Course is focused on seminars and discussion to help the participants form their own views and answers, both on a teoretical and a practical level, to key questions like:
- What is a good scientific study in software engineering (SE)? 
- What is a good SE paper? 
- What is the difference between publishing in a journal and at a conference? 
- Do different publication venues have different requirements and status? 
- Where should I target my papers? 
- How does review processes work? 
- How do I review papers? 
- What is this thing called science? 
- Is software engineering a science?

The course is based on seminars to which PhD students prepare and after which they write down their views in (a) brief report(s). The idea is to give hands-on practical advice and show examples of how the software engineering research community functions. Since the course is an initial course, limited in size and scope, we go broad rather than in depth. But, at least, participants get a grounding in key activities and practices and can then go deeper as they see fit. 

## Course goals
After completion of the course the students is expected to be able to: 
- Read SE research papers and describe their motivation, the methods used and the results achieved
- State the strong and weak points of an SE study, the threats to validity as well as how the study can be improved
- Identify the research paradigm and method used in a SE study and compare it to alternative methods
- Write good and constructive reviews of scientific papers in software engineering
- Apply review templates objectively even on their own research studies and papers
- Select relevant publication targets for their research
- Describe (strong) publication targets for SE in general as well as for their sub-area
- Write and update publication strategies for their research
- Define bibliometrics used to rank publication targets, journals and researchers, as well as their benefits and drawbacks

## About Robert
Robert will introduce topics and lead discussions. He has a long background in Software Engineering both in academia (professor at Chalmers and BTH since 2013, PhD in 2002) and with 30+ years of experience from software consulting. He has high standards and can be demanding but he really wants you to develop and grow and will go to great lengths to help you do that. Robert's interest in finding the "practical truth" about the area started early, when he was a PhD student himself at Chalmers. At that time there was not much information to be found, or at least the information was not aggregated. So Robert started collecting info and created a knowledge base (that has now grown into [his advice page](http://www.robertfeldt.net/advice/index.html)). He is passionate about giving the "bare truth" to students early so they can find their way in SE and to achieve things, in their careers, that they aspire to.

Robert Feldt is Professor of Software Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, where he is part of the Software Engineering division at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. He is also a part-time Professor of Software Engineering at Blekinge Institute of Technology in Karlskrona, Sweden. Since April 2017  he has been co-Editor in Chief of one of the major journals in Software Engineering, Springer's the [Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) Journal](https://www.springer.com/journal/10664).

## Course instances
Robert first gave the course at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg during 2009-2012 and then in a short version, focused on journal and conference publication and reviewing, from 2019-2023 at Blekinge Institute of Technology.

During 2023 the course was reworked and extended to be given as a 2-day intensive course at NTNU in Trondheim, Norway.

### Trondheim course 2023-11-16
The course was organized as a two-day event with 2 seminars per day:
- [Seminar 1](https://github.com/robertfeldt/sci-pub-se/blob/main/tasks/seminar_1_2023.md): Science, community, and bibliometrics
- [Seminar 2](https://github.com/robertfeldt/sci-pub-se/blob/main/tasks/seminar_2_2023.md): Publication, it's processes and your publication strategy
- [Seminar 3](): Reading and reviewing Papers
- [Seminar 4](): Research methods and validity threats
