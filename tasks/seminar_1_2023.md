# Seminar 1: Science, its processes and community
The focus of seminar 1 is science and engineering, the scientific community and it's processes, as well as bibliometrics. Before the seminar you should study the preporatory material and think about and write down your own answer to the preporatory questions. After the seminar you should write down brief answers to the assignment questions and include them in your course report.

## Preporatory study materials
P1.1. Watch these short videos on Feynman, Cox, Popper and Kuhns' views on what science is:
  - [What is science?](https://youtu.be/kBqemHR49-c?si=xFr7OSMx3s21yxzF)
  - [Karl Popper, Science, and Pseudo-science](https://youtu.be/-X8Xfl0JdTQ?si=h-tcMnvCFo_vyaV6)
  - [Thomas Kuhn, normal science](https://youtu.be/sOGZEZ96ynI?si=ZHVuKwaRC1uGU19K)
  - [Thomas Kuhn, scientific revolutions](https://youtu.be/JQPsc55zsXA?si=K3jZasWejUJ4QSU2)

P1.2 Read Schafersman on Science
  - [Copy of Schafersman 'Introduction to Science'](https://gehrcke.de/2014/06/steven-d-schafersmans-introduction-to-science/)

P1.3. Read about the difference between Engineering and Science:
  - [The Difference Between Science and Engineering](https://www.engineering.com/story/the-difference-between-science-and-engineering)

## Preporatory questions
- PQ1. What is science?
- PQ2. How is science different from engineering?
- PQ3. How is science different from a process improvement project in a company (for example, trying to find a better way to capture bugs found during early stages in software projects)?
- PQ4. What kind of science is Software Engineering?
- PQ5. Why is publication important in science?
- PQ6. Why is a scientific/research community central for scientific processes?
- PQ7. What are the two most common bibliometric measures out there and how are they
calculated?

## Assignment questions
- AQ1.1. What are the advantages and disadvantages/risks with bibliometric metrics such as the h-index?
- AQ1.2 Can you, for example, compare the h-index of a person in, say, formal methods, to those of a person in SE? Or someone in medicine to those of someone in SE.
- AQ1.3 Should hiring committees care about bibliometric measures when assessing candidates for a university faculty position? Do you think they do, or not?
- AQ1.4. Should you be aware of bibliometric measures in your own academic career/project? Why? How?
