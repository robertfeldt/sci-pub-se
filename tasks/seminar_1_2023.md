# Seminar 1: Science, its processes and community
The focus of seminar 1 is science and engineering, the scientific community and it's processes, as well as bibliometrics. 

Before the seminar it is recommended that you consider the preparatory questions below. You can use the "Suggested reading/materials" to give input to this and inspire your preparatory thinking. Below we also list additional, post-seminar tasks and material that you can consider to go further/deeper after the seminar.

## Preporatory questions
- PQ1.1. What is science? How is science different from engineering? How is science different from a process improvement project in a company (for example, trying to find a better way to capture bugs found during early stages in software projects)?
- PQ1.2. Why is publication important in science?
- PQ1.3. Why is a scientific/research community central for scientific processes?

## Suggested Reading/Materials
M1.1. Watch these short videos on Feynman, Cox, Popper and Kuhns' views on what science is:
  - [What is science?](https://youtu.be/kBqemHR49-c?si=xFr7OSMx3s21yxzF)
  - [Karl Popper, Science, and Pseudo-science](https://youtu.be/-X8Xfl0JdTQ?si=h-tcMnvCFo_vyaV6)
  - [Thomas Kuhn, normal science](https://youtu.be/sOGZEZ96ynI?si=ZHVuKwaRC1uGU19K)
  - [Thomas Kuhn, scientific revolutions](https://youtu.be/JQPsc55zsXA?si=K3jZasWejUJ4QSU2)

M1.2 Read Schafersman on Science
  - [Copy of Schafersman 'Introduction to Science'](https://gehrcke.de/2014/06/steven-d-schafersmans-introduction-to-science/)

M1.3. Read about the difference between Engineering and Science:
  - [The Difference Between Science and Engineering](https://www.engineering.com/story/the-difference-between-science-and-engineering)

## Additional questions/tasks (post-seminar, for the interested)
- AQ1.1. What kind of science is Software Engineering?
- AQ1.2. What are the two most common bibliometric measures out there and how are they
calculated?
- AQ1.3. What are the advantages and disadvantages/risks with bibliometric metrics such as the h-index? Can you, for example, compare the h-index of a person in, say, formal methods, to those of a person in SE? Or someone in medicine to those of someone in SE.
- AQ1.4 Should hiring committees care about bibliometric measures when assessing candidates for a university faculty position? Do you think they do, or not? 
- AQ1.5. Should you be aware of bibliometric measures in your own academic career/project? Why? How?
- AQ1.6. Find two papers in your sub-area of SE that you think are important for science, one being highly cited and one not highly cited. Discuss why you think one might have gotten more citations over the years and the other one didn't. Does one of them do/represent better or worse science, from your point of view?
