# Seminar 1: Science, its processes and community
The focus of seminar 1 is on publication processes, how they work, and how you can develop a publication strategy. It is not enough just to do good research and then send it to any forum; you need to have a strategy for where to send what. To develop this you need to understand how processes of publication works for different fora, mainly for conferences and journals. We will discuss how these processes look, what you should strive for in your papers and which strategic choices are available.

Before the seminar you should study the preporatory material and think about and write down your own answer to the preporatory questions. After the seminar you should write down brief answers to the assignment questions and include them in your course report.

## Preporatory study materials
- P2.1. Read Mary Shaw's paper ["Writing Good Software Engineering Research Papers"](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~Compose/shaw-icse03.pdf)
- P2.2. Sense About Science, [“Peer Review - The Nuts and Bolts”](https://senseaboutscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PEER-REVIEW-the-nuts-and-bolts.pdf), 2021

## Preporatory questions
- PQ1. What is the difference between a journal and a conference paper?
- PQ2. What are blind and double-blind review processes? What are the possible
advantages/disadvantages of each?
- PQ3. What is a good SE research paper?
- PQ4. What is open science and how can you make your science more open?
- PQ5. What are registered reports and what are the argument for and against them?

## Assignment question
AQ2.1 Write your (one page) publication strategy that:
- a, Describes your focus area (within SE) briefly and the goals of your strategy
- b, Gives an overall description of publication strategy and its development over time in your PhD project (the latter part depends on where you are in your studies)
- c, Describes how you should choose which forum to publish in
- d, List the Workshops, Conferences and Journals that you plan to focus on and, for each one, briefly states why they have been included.
