# Seminar 3: Reading and reviewing papers
The focus of seminar 3 is on how to read and review scientific papers in SE.

Before the seminar it is recommended that you consider the preparatory questions below. You can use the "Suggested reading/materials" to give input to this and inspire your preparatory thinking. Below we also list additional, post-seminar tasks and material that you can consider to go further/deeper after the seminar.

## Preporatory questions
- PQ3.1. What are the top-3 things you think a reviewer **should** focus on when reviewing an SE paper? Why?
- PQ3.2. What are some aspects a reviewer **should** put **less** emphasis on when reviewing a paper? Why?
- PQ3.3. Would you say that reviewers tend to be good at judging the **relevance** of a piece of research? How do you think they tend to judge **relevance**?

## Suggested Reading/Materials
M3.1. Read Alan Smith's ["The Task of the Referee"](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_sdt=0%2C5&q=smith+task+of+the+referee&btnG=)

M3.2 Read the ["General standard" guideline](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/docs/GeneralStandard.md) for SE papers from the "Empirical Standards for Software Engineering Research"
  - Latest PDF of ["Empirical Standards for Software Engineering Research"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03525)

M3.3 ICSE 2024 Review Criteria as stated in it's [call for paper](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2024/icse-2024-research-track#Call-for-papers)

## Additional questions/tasks (post-seminar, for the interested)
- AQ3.1. Generate a specific "Empirical Standards" guideline for a paper you are writing, have recently finished, or is about to review [using the online tool](https://www2.sigsoft.org/EmpiricalStandards/tools/)
