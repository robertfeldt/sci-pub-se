# Seminar 4: Research methods and validity threats
The focus of seminar 4 is on the main types of research approaches and methods used in Software Engineering. In particular we discuss quantitative and qualitative research, theoretic and empirical research, primary and secondary research, experiments, case studies, action research, systematic reviews and maps, interviews, and questionnaires. However, the information is cursory with the intent of being able to read, understand and comment on different types of methods; not on being able to design research using all of the methods.

Before the seminar it is recommended that you consider the preparatory questions below. You can use the "Suggested reading/materials" to give input to this and inspire your preparatory thinking. Below we also list additional, post-seminar tasks and material that you can consider to go further/deeper after the seminar.

## Preporatory questions
- PQ4.1. Which research methods have you used in your research so far? Which ones are you planning to use? Why were these methods chosen?
- PQ4.2. In the studies you have done so far or are planning to do in the near-term, what are the top-3 threats to the validity of your results? What did you do or can you do to mitigate them (in a better way) going forward?

## Suggested Reading/Materials
M4.1. Read the recent Verdecchia et al paper ["Threats to validity in software engineering research: A critical reflection"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584923001842?casa_token=_NTid5hsPucAAAAA:e0XXgCweBl3OXEGgqj-ph4fBO_SvjkTXq8AHxtgkgDY0-ArtIRgRO5dAFDp9MQVPaonmW3F4XNc).

## Additional questions/tasks (post-seminar, for the interested)
- AQ4.1. Are there **alternative** research methods you could employ but have not? Describe at least one such alternative and think of an example of a study in which to use it and its overall design. What would this type of study add to your project compared to your currently employed methods?
